            <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
            <p>I'm Jared Woodcock and I am seeking a career in web development. I enjoy turning ideas into fascinating, interactive experiences on the web.</p>
            <p>My journey in web development began by trying to find the thing that I was passionate about. I have always enjoyed building things and
                knowing the in's and out's of how things work. I have also always had a love for computers. So this led me to one day coming across web development.
                After doing ample research on the topic, I decided to enroll in a Full-Stack Coding bootcamp and it turned out to be exactly what I was looking for.
                Something that made me feel that sense of accomplishment after completing projects and knowing that I made these features work. 
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending my time watching and playing sports, playing with my dogs, and being around friends and family. 
                I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies and techniques to enhance my skills and create impactful projects.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate or just say hello!</p>
